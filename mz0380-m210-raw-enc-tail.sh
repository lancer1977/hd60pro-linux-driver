# Bounded M210 discriminator: the M209 sink topology WITH the Windows encoder
# tail.
#
# M209 ran the whole raw-only sequence and the card never wrote a frame token:
# irq_total=8, frame_events=0, the BAR0 sentinel intact, all eight slots still
# poisoned.  op 0x06 alone does not start this firmware's producer.  Raw-only
# differed from the working 60 fps H.264 start in two ways - no op04 sink and
# no encoder tail - and only the tail can explain a dead producer.
#
# This run changes exactly that one variable: identical eight-slot op02/op08
# topology, still no op04, plus SET_ENC_PARAMS x2 and SET_PREVIEW_PARAMS sent
# byte for byte as the H.264 path sends them.  Windows does not send op 0x06
# when the tail is present, so neither does this; the deadline therefore starts
# at SET_PREVIEW_PARAMS instead.
#
# One-shot: it stops at the earlier of eight exact frames or two seconds after
# the tail completes, never enables h264_probe, and treats any op04
# registration or second SET_VIC as failure.
