 * and never sends START_STREAMING (0x06) on the capture path: 0x2d and 0x31
 * are themselves bare sysfs_notify("epint") doorbells in ep.ko, which is the
 * same wake 0x06 performs. Buffers are registered before the reconfiguration,
 * when the capture pin opens.
 *
 * 1 selects that order. 0 is the pre-M82 order
 * (0x29 -> 0x2d -> SET_BUF -> 0x2a -> 0x06), which is what every run up to and
 * including M81 used.
 *
 * DEFAULT IS 0, deliberately. M90 showed on hardware that win_seq=1 renders
 * nothing at all - not even the card's NO SIGNAL splash - while win_seq=0 with
 * fw=5 reliably renders it (760/1024 pages, M88). Both variables are necessary
 * and they interact. A default that is known not to reach the splash is a trap:
 * it silently confounds every experiment run "with defaults", which is exactly

 * The handler at 0xef24 stores byte 0x0e to
 * EncodingGroup::preview_params_settings[ch].byte[0x0a] UNCONDITIONALLY - the
 * validity mask gates only byte 0x0c (die_en, mask bit 4). That is the exact

 *           pthread_create(&t, NULL, EncodingGroup::fake_frame_process, this);

 * otherwise. The second spawn site, in EncodingGroup::Start (0x10f30), is
 * gated by is_nosg instead, which we already send as 0.

 * The guard runs inside the op-0x06 handler (which news the EncodingGroups,
 * then pthread_create's on_start_thread -> Start -> init_func), so 0x31 only
 * has an effect if it lands BEFORE START_STREAMING.
 *
 * Why it is worth a spawn: the "real frames are rejected in
 * libtkmf_video_source.so.0" mechanism is static RE only - the card's console
 * is not reachable, so we have never observed the drop. With the standby
 * thread suppressed there is nothing left to emit a frame except the real
 * encode path, which splits the two remaining stories cleanly:
 *   NO FRAME   -> the rejection is real; nothing ever reaches the encoder.
 *   real frame -> the standby thread was winning the race and masking it.
 * M131: DEFAULT CHANGED 0 -> 1. With it at 0 the card draws NOSG_LOGO_Y over a
 * perfectly good capture, which is what hid real video from this project for
 * its entire life (M129). Set it to 0 only to reproduce a pre-M129 result.

 * fopen("/tmp/PIC_INSERT","rb"), which cannot exist, so it sets
 * g_insert_pic = 0 and bare-ACKs (tinyvenc5 0xf068 -> 0xffac). The MemBroker
 * allocation that would have followed is never reached. Nothing it writes
 * touches capture, DMA or the VIC.
 *
 * What DID change is the mailbox cadence in front of START_STREAMING. ep.ko
 * serves one command at a time out of the mailbox and pokes it at the card as
 * a bare sysfs_notify("epint"); tinyvenc5 wakes, reads 44 bytes, and services
 * it. Measured on the two runs:
 *
 *   baseline   SET_AIC -> [156 ms, spent in the output-stage diag] -> 0x06
 *   with 0x31  SET_AIC -> [156 ms diag] -> 0x31 -> [9 us] -> 0x06
 *
 * Nine microseconds. 0x06 is fire-and-forget (timeout_ms = 0), so it does not
 * wait for anything, and it lands on the doorbell while tinyvenc5 is still
 * inside the 0x31 handler. Every other command in the sequence is tens to
 * hundreds of ms apart. That is the one thing 0x31 changes that could plausibly
 * truncate a transfer, and it also explains M91 without needing win_bufs_first.
 *
 * A gap is one variable from the run that produced the stall. Nonzero and the
 * frame comes back whole => cadence, and 0x31 is usable, which is what
 * fake_frame_off needs. Still 16 bytes at, say, 200 ms => the race is not it
 * and the 0x31 handler needs another read.
