"""Decide whether an m55 capture is the card's NO SIGNAL splash - by identity.

M126 scored this on the chroma plane ("UV unique == 1"), which is a heuristic:
it says "no live pixels", not "this is the splash". M127 identified the picture
exactly. It is NOSG_LOGO_Y, a 320x240 Y-only data symbol inside the card's
tinyvenc5 (ELF vaddr 0x6b10c, 0x12c00 bytes), blitted dead-centre into an
otherwise 0x11 (video black) 1920x1080 frame by EncodingGroup::fake_frame_process:

    dst x = (1920 - 320) / 2 = 800
    dst y = (1080 - 240) / 2 = 420
    dst stride = 1920, 320 bytes per row, 240 rows

So the test is a SHA-256 of that crop. The asset itself is vendor firmware and
is deliberately NOT vendored into this tree - only its digest is, which is
enough to recognise it and nothing more.

Three outcomes, and the third is the one worth having:

    SPLASH          - crop hashes to the known asset. The VIC saw no signal and
                      the card drew its own picture. Nothing changed.
    NOT SPLASH      - the frame is something else. Whatever the run varied,
                      it moved the picture. Look at it.
    NO FRAME        - short file. The encoder never rendered; usually means the
                      run broke tinyvenc5 rather than the capture path.
