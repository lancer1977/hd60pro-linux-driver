# M30: the DMA no longer faults - but is the card writing?
#
# M29 got the fault count to 0 for the first time. That is necessarily
# ambiguous: an IOMMU reports only the writes that MISS, so "no faults" means
# either "every write landed in our buffer" or "no writes happened". Neither
# the frame-token log nor the IRQ count moved (still 4, all command-done), so
# the completion path told us nothing either.
#
# This run dumps the buffer contents at streamoff, plus the card's status
# words, which separates the two cases.
#
# READ THE "stop buf[i]" LINES:
#   head=00 00 00 01 ... , pages non-zero > 0
#       -> THE CARD IS WRITING H.264 INTO OUR MEMORY. DMA is done; what is
#          broken is the completion signal (no frame-done MSI / token), so the
#          next hunt is the EVENT/token path, not the address path.
#   head all 00, 0 pages non-zero
#       -> nothing landed. The card stopped writing when the faults stopped,
#          which would mean the target it now has is one it declines to use.
#          Compare EVENT/enc words against the M29 run.
#   head non-zero but not 00 00 00 01
#       -> something lands but it is not an H.264 access unit; dump more of it
#          before trusting the length/token fields.
