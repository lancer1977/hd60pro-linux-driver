# M171/M172: reload the module and run v4l2-compliance.
#
# ZERO encoder spawns - this never streams, so it is free to re-run as often as
# you like. That matters: conformance is the one test in this tree that costs
# nothing against a spawn budget of 8-18 per power cycle.
#
# Baseline: 148 tests. M170 was 132/16. M171 fixed the control-range,
# readbuffers and DV-timings-contract defects and took it to 142/6. M172 fixes
# the last six.
#
# The 5 remaining warnings are V4L2_CID_DV_RX_POWER_PRESENT, one per input.
# That control is an ADDITION - the driver has the information and does not
# export it - not a correction, so it is deliberately still a warning.
