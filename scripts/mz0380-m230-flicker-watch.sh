# M230: watch the counters that separate the possible causes of the SECOND
# flicker - the 0.5-to-1-second black the operator still sees in OBS on the
# non-YU12 formats after M229 closed the single-frame blanks.
#
# That duration is 30 to 60 consecutive frames at 60 fps, so it is not the
# defect M226 measured, and a 1200-frame capture found no blanks at all. The
# candidates make DIFFERENT counters move, which is the whole point of watching
# rather than guessing:
#
#   pixelformat flips to H264   -> OBS is not on the raw path for that format.
#                                  BGR3/YV12 come from libv4l2 emulation, which
#                                  may fall back to H264 instead of converting
#                                  from YU12. Then this is an H.264 defect and
#                                  nothing about raw applies.
#   raw dropped climbing        -> buffer starvation; the node had no vb2 buffer
#                                  to deliver into.
#   raw fills climbing hard     -> M229 is rejecting nearly every slot, so the
#                                  card stopped finishing fills.
#   placeholder IDRs delivered  -> the NO SIGNAL replay is on screen. At
#                                  no_signal_fps=2 that blacks the picture for
#                                  exactly this kind of duration.
#   h264 dropped / 0 SPS+PPS    -> the encoded path is broken, which is the
#                                  known post-raw-session defect.
#   nothing moves at all        -> the driver delivered normally throughout and
#                                  the black is downstream of it, in libv4l2 or
#                                  in OBS.
