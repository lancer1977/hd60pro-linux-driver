# M51b: which GPIO pins are actually there, and which float HIGH?
#
# The first bit-bang attempt (M51) aborted on both pin orders with "SDA
# reads LOW when released" for pins 12/13. Two candidate causes, both
# cheap to separate:
#   (a) pins 12/13 do not exist / are not the I2C pair - an older probe saw
#       only bits 3 and 6 high at idle, so the port may be narrow;
#   (b) the GPIO_DIR (op 0x17) data-bit polarity is inverted from our
#       guess, which swaps release/drive and makes ANY line look stuck low.
#
# This script dumps the idle level of all 32 pins (I2C pairs sit on
# pull-ups => read HIGH when idle), then retries the ACK scan on every
# HIGH pin pair, under BOTH direction polarities.
#
# Decision table:
#   - two or more pins read HIGH, and a scan on some pair reports
#     "ACK at 0x50" -> the DDC EEPROM is found; burn with
#       echo "edidburn <sda> <scl> 50" | sudo tee /proc/mz0380-hdmi
#   - HIGH pins exist but every pair scans with 0 ACKs -> those pins are
#     not the DDC pair (they may be status inputs); the EEPROM is likely
#     only reachable from the card's own /dev/i2c-1, which the mailbox
#     does not expose -> back to the Windows-trace plan.
#   - NO pin reads HIGH under either polarity -> op 0x14 does not sample
#     real pin state for this port (it may return the output latch), and
#     the bit-bang route is blind; abandon it.
