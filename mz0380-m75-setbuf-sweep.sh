# M75: which mailbox opcode programs the encoder's DMA destination buffers?
#
# We have always sent 0x02. The Windows driver builds the SAME 12-word command
# (doorbell, opcode, channel, stride, then {hi,lo} address pairs) with opcodes
# 0x04 and 0x05 - win64.txt 0x140279219 and 0x140279663, r8d=0xc words, payload
# pulled from an address array in dword pairs.
#
# 0x02 provably reaches a channel: the card's synthetic NV12 path DMAs into
# those buffers. But the H.264 bitstream may come from a channel whose
# addresses 0x02 never programs - leaving the encoder running with nowhere to
# write, which is exactly what we see (receiver locked 59s, enc_stat 0, every
# host page untouched).
#
# Each pass costs ONE encoder spawn, so the whole sweep stays well under the
# ~8-18 spawn wedge budget.
#
# Decision: any pass reporting NONZERO "pages touched" identifies the opcode.
