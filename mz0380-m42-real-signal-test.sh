# M42: real-signal bring-up. THE pivot away from the dead stream_nosg path.
#
# M41 closed the fake path: its DMA park is card-internal (missing DMAC
# completion IRQ) and unreachable from the host. The real path uses the same
# DMA machinery but runs in the card's encode_handler, paced by vpl_vic
# capture interrupts - and it is the product goal anyway.
#
# New in the driver for this run:
#   - EDID (the recovered 256-byte HD60 Pro blob) is loaded into the
#     receiver's DDC EEPROM at bring-up, then HPD is asserted. Without a
#     readable EDID an HDMI source keeps its transmitter OFF, which is why
#     every previous nosg=0 attempt saw a dead input.
#   - SET_VIC now carries the real fps (was always 0 -> card forced 60).
#   - streamon re-detects the live timing and refuses to start without lock.
#   - enc_stat handshake byte is acked (BAR0+0x50), required for frame 2+.
#
# PLUG A LIVE HDMI SOURCE INTO THE CARD'S INPUT BEFORE RUNNING THIS.
#
# READ THE RESULT:
#   "EDID loaded" + "HPD asserted"        -> the sink side is now real. If the
#       source still shows nothing, check the source's own output/EDID cache
#       (some need a physical re-plug after the first HPD edge).
#   "MST3367 signal: WxH..."              -> RECEIVER LOCKED. This alone is a
#       first: every prior run had no signal at all.
#   "MST3367 locked but unmatched"        -> lock is real, mode table needs the
#       reported geometry adding (paste the line into RE_FINDINGS).
#   "frame token=..." / irq second column -> FRAMES FLOWING. The DMAC IRQ is
#       alive on the real path and the fake-path park was a fake-path problem.
#   lock but no frames                    -> the DMAC completion IRQ really is
#       dead on this unit; next stop is the VIC/BT1120 routing into the SSM
#       ring (op 0x50 and the vpl_vic config).
