# M48: HPD, and ONLY HPD.
#
# Every test so far moved several things at once (input select, receiver
# init, EDID push, HPD), and the source reacted exactly ONCE across all of
# them - which is as easily explained by a camera idle-timeout as by our
# hotplug edge. Five EDID opcodes (0x20/0x1f/0x1e/0x1b/0x1d) produced no
# reaction at all, so the EDID route via the mailbox looks closed.
#
# This changes ONE variable. It pulses the hotplug line 5 times with 4 s
# between edges and does nothing else. A source that sees a sink appear and
# disappear should react EVERY time, reproducibly.
#
# WATCH THE CAMERA SCREEN FOR THE WHOLE RUN (~40 s) and note whether it
# reacts on each "assert" line, once, or never.
#
# WHAT IT MEANS:
#   reacts on EVERY pulse
#       -> we really do own the board's hotplug line. Then the EDID is being
#          served by something we do not drive (the factory-programmed EDID
#          MCU the RE docs describe), and the remaining fault is the
#          receiver's own per-mode configuration - the values from M10 step 2
#          that were never recovered. A live Windows I2C trace is then the
#          shortest path, and it is the SAME trace that would settle EDID.
#   reacts NEVER (and the first time was a coincidence)
#       -> our HPD is not reaching the connector. GPIO pin1 reads back as 1,
#          so either pin1 is not the hotplug line on this board revision, or
#          the pin drives something behind a buffer that also needs the EDID
#          MCU alive. Next: sweep the other GPIO pins one at a time and watch
#          the camera, which is the only oracle we have.
#   reacts only the first time
#       -> the source latches sink-presence and will not re-read without a
#          longer HPD-low period; re-run with a longer gap:
#             sudo bash mz0380-m48-hpd-test.sh 5 8000
