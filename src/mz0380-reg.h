/*
 *  Driver for MZ0380 based capture cards (Elgato HD60 Pro family).
 *
 *  Register map, derived from our own reverse engineering of this board: the
 *  card's firmware image (yuan_demo_sdi: ep.ko, video_capture_mgr, tinyvenc5/7)
 *  and the Windows driver e60MZ0380.X64.SYS. See RE_FINDINGS.md.
 *
 *  Hardware overview:
 *    The MZ0380 board has two layers:
 *      1. A Xilinx FPGA bridge in front of an ARMv5 Mozart SoC (Vatics Mozart
 *         395s). The SoC boots its own embedded Linux from the card's OWN
 *         FLASH. The host never uploads firmware - the upload path was removed
 *         from this driver entirely.
 *      2. On the host side, the Xilinx fabric exposes two PCIe BARs:
 *           BAR0 : 1 MiB MMIO  - command mailbox and firmware buffer
 *           BAR5 : 4 KiB CFG   - SDK property/control window
 *
 *    What BAR0 does NOT contain, all established on hardware:
 *      - no host-visible Xilinx XDMA descriptor controller
 *      - no host-driven AXI IIC: I2C to the MST3367 goes over the mailbox
 *        (op 0x1a/0x1b), and the receiver is held in reset by GPIO pin 9
 *      - no HDMI signal-status window: the card never pushes the input format
 *        to the host over PCIe at all. Host-side detect is done by reading the
 *        MST3367 through the mailbox I2C proxy.
 *
 *    Earlier revisions of this file carried Sections B/C/D modelling all three
 *    of those on the sc0710 driver for a different card (Elgato 4K60 Pro
 *    Mk.2). Every define in them went unused and the model was disproved; they
 *    were deleted in 2026-08. Nothing in this driver derives from sc0710.
 *

 * store sequence at 0x14028c8ba and confirmed against the driver's own printf
 * "mask = %08X, i = %d, fps = %d, skip = %d, avg = %d, di = %d, osd = %d,
 * mirror = %d, flip = %d":
 *     [4..7]   u32 mask = 0x1F   (all five fields valid)

 * Both board flags and the [18] byte are zero on the 0x1C/0xFA (Elgato) board:
 * every branch that sets them tests a board id this card does not have, or a
 * context flag that read zero in all four traces. So the packet the HD60 Pro
 * actually receives is { 0x1F, fps<<8, 0x01, 0, 0 } - di = 1.
 *
 * ep.ko routes op 49 (0x31) to "notify epint" and nothing else, i.e. it is a
 * pure doorbell that wakes the encoder. Windows never sends START_STREAMING
 * (0x06) on the capture path at all; 0x2d and 0x31 are what kick tinyvenc.
 *
 * M128: the card's own name for 0x31 is SET_PREVIEW_PARAMS, and tinyvenc5's
 * printf at 0xf570 gives every field, which supersedes the guessed labels
 * above where the two disagree:
 *     [4..7] mask   [8] ch   [9] fps   [0x0a] skip   [0x0b] avg
 *     [0x0c] die_en ("di")   [0x0d] preview_off
 *     [0x0e] fake_frame_off  ("board_flag_b" above - it is not a board flag)
 *     [0x0f] preview_no_osd ("osd")
 *     [0x10] mirror   [0x11] flip   [0x12] hw_d
 * (the Windows read had mirror/flip the other way round; the card's printf
 * wins.) ep.ko's payload length for 0x31 is 20, so [20..23] never arrive.
 *
 * fake_frame_off is the gate on EncodingGroup::fake_frame_process, the thread
 * that draws NOSG_LOGO_Y. Windows sends 0 there, i.e. retail leaves the
 * standby splash armed too. See mz0380_fake_frame_off in mz0380-core.c.
