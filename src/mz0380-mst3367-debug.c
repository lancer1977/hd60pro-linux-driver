 * M45. The connected camera visibly reacts to running the bring-up (its live

 * never reports lock.
 *
 * Watch the detect block live so a plug/unplug or camera power-cycle can be
 * correlated with what the chip sees. reg 0x55 is the status byte: bit2..5
 * (mask 0x3c) are the lock bits the GPL driver gates on.
 *
 * M173 settled what the other bits are, by watching R55 across a live
 * unplug/replug. This comment used to say bits 0..1 were "most plausibly
 * 5V/clock presence" and that guess stood unexamined for the life of the
 * project. It is WRONG: bits 0..1 read 3 with the cable in AND with it out,
 * while the lock bits went 0x3c -> 0x00 -> 0x3c. They are stuck high and carry
 * no status. This card has no +5V detect, which is why
 * V4L2_CID_DV_RX_POWER_PRESENT is not implemented.
 *
 * What does track the cable is mask 0x7c - so bit 6 moves with the signal
 * exactly as the 0x3c lock bits do, and neither we nor hdcapm gate on it.

 * M73: dump the receiver's OUTPUT stage.
 *
 * Everything upstream is now proven: the receiver locks, measures a clean
 * 1080p60 and holds it for tens of seconds. Everything downstream is armed:
 * SET_VIC carries legal values, the encoder spawns, START fires. Yet the card
 * writes nothing at all - the buffer poison scan reads 0/1024 pages touched -
 * and tinyvenc5 opens the VIC itself ("Can't create video capture -> exit"),
 * so a VIC that never sees a BT1120 clock is the remaining explanation.
 *
 * We configure that output stage in commit_digital_output() and have never
 * once read it back. These are the registers that gate it:
 *   BANK0 0xab bit7 - freeze/hold, set around the 0xb0 update and cleared
 *   BANK0 0xb0      - output format/clock select (hdcapm writes 0x20 for
 *                     "YUV422 / 8-bit output"; we write 0x21 for non-720p30)
 *   BANK0 0xb1/0xb2 - output config / special-mode select
 *   BANK0 0xb3      - written 0xff by the Windows indirect-port path
 *   BANK2 0x07      - the timing latch (bit4 pulsed on first acquisition)
 * plus 0x55 so the lock state at the same instant is on the same line.
