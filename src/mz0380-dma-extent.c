/*
 * M217: is there a whole frame in this slot, in O(1)?
 *
 * mz0380_raw_probe_infer_length() answers a harder question - "how many bytes
 * did the card write" - by scanning backwards from the end of a 4.6 MB buffer.
 * For the 16-byte stub that walks the entire buffer, so at 60 fps it costs
 * ~276 MB/s of reads before the whole-buffer re-poison writes it back. That is
 * affordable for a diagnostic that runs a few hundred times; it is not
 * affordable for a capture path.
 *
 * We no longer need to infer anything. M213 read the transfer length out of
 * tinyvenc7 (ALIGN16(W) * H * 3/2) and M215 confirmed it on hardware, and M214
 * showed the card only ever writes that length or a 16-byte stub. So the only
 * question is which of the two arrived, and a handful of sentinels answers it.
 *
 * The sentinels sit near the END of the frame - a stub touches only the first
 * sixteen bytes, so anything past that distinguishes the two - and they are
 * SPREAD rather than adjacent. Adjacent sentinels all land in one image region,
 * and a saturated flat area of a real frame could in principle carry the poison
 * value across a few contiguous bytes. Spreading them over different rows and
 * planes makes a false "not landed" require the same coincidence in four
 * unrelated places at once.

 * SET_VIC - i.e. from our own capture geometry. M218 then advertised YU12 at
 * 1280x720, 720x480 and 720x576 as well, at which point every use of the
 * 1080p-sized MZ0380_RAW_PROBE_FRAME_SIZE became wrong: sentinels landing past
 * the end of a shorter frame stay poison forever, so the frame never reads as
 * landed and nothing is delivered at all. One of the fixed offsets was even

 * hardware that the card CLEARS a slot to black before filling it - luma 0x01,
 * chroma 0x80 - so the clear removes every sentinel at once and "landed" goes
 * true the moment the clear lands, long before the picture arrives. Delivered
 * frames were therefore all black when the copy ran early, and picture on top
 * with black below when it ran mid-fill, with the boundary moving between
 * roughly row 700 and row 930 from frame to frame.
 *
 * No sentinel value or offset can fix that, because the clear touches every
 * byte the sentinels could occupy. But the clear leaves its own signature, and
 * that IS testable: if the last luma rows still read entirely as the clear
 * byte, the fill has not reached the end of the picture.
 *
 * Sampled, not scanned - reading the whole tail per completion would cost more
 * bandwidth than the copy it guards. Any single sample differing from the
 * clear value proves the region was written, so this is deliberately
 * permissive: it rejects only a tail that is uniformly the clear byte.
 *
 * The false negative is a frame whose last rows are genuinely flat black. That
 * frame is held back for one completion and the next one delivers, which costs
 * a frame of a black picture and cannot persist. The opposite trade - passing
 * a half-filled frame - is the defect this exists to stop.
