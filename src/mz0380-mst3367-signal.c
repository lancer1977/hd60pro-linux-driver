 * M58 (hardware). Only htotal is in a different domain than hdcapm's table.
 * The clean full-lock sample reads
 *
 *   htot=2200 vtot=1125 hper=674 vper=599
 *
 * where vtotal (1125) and vperiod (599 == 60.0Hz, from 1250000/raw) already
 * sit inside the 1080p60 row, confirming hdcapm's vertical constants on this
 * silicon; hperiod likewise (raw 2372 -> 160MHz reference -> 67.4kHz). But
 * htotal is the TRUE video total, 2200, against the table's 3290-3310. That
 * split is not new: hdcapm's own table carries 720p60 twice, at 1650 (true)
 * and 2475 (x1.5), because the chip reports either depending on the clock
 * domain it locks in.
 *
 * So the table stays verbatim and only htotal is normalised. Raw units are
 * tried first, since the chip does report the x1.5 domain for some sources.
 *
 * M79 (hardware). A third domain exists, and it is HDMI DEEP COLOUR. The
 * chip counts htotal in TMDS character clocks, which deep colour scales:
 * 24-bit = x1, 30-bit = x1.25, 36-bit = x1.5. That is exactly why hdcapm
 * carries 720p60 twice (1650 true, 2475 = x1.5): the second row is a 36-bit
 * source, not a different mode.
 *
 * A source arriving here read htot=2750 vtot=1125 hact=1920 hper=674
 * vper=599 - self-consistent 1080p60 in every field except htotal, and
 * 2750 == 2200 x 1.25, i.e. 30-bit deep colour. Only the TMDS-domain counter
 * moves: hperiod and vperiod run off a fixed reference and read unchanged
 * (67.4 kHz / 59.9 Hz), and hactive is a video-domain counter and reads a
 * true 1920. The table sits in the x1.5 domain, so the correction from a
 * 30-bit measurement is x1.5/x1.25 = x6/5: 2750 * 6 / 5 == 3300, dead centre
 * of the 1080p60 row. Without it a perfectly good 1080p60 source is rejected
 * as "coherent but unsupported" and never reaches STREAMON at all.
 *
 * (M57 read x1.25/x0.8 into the vertical fields too. That was fitted to one
 * torn sample - htot=2200 vtot=899 vper=750 is a self-consistent 75Hz, the
 * right TMDS clock with vsync still settling, not a unit mismatch. Retracted.)
