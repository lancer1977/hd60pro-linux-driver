 * validity mask gates only byte 0x0c (die_en, mask bit 4). That is the exact

 * otherwise. The second spawn site, in EncodingGroup::Start (0x10f30), is
 * gated by is_nosg instead, which we already send as 0.

 * The guard runs inside the op-0x06 handler (which news the EncodingGroups,
 * then pthread_create's on_start_thread -> Start -> init_func), so 0x31 only
 * has an effect if it lands BEFORE START_STREAMING.
 *
 * Why it is worth a spawn: the "real frames are rejected in
 * libtkmf_video_source.so.0" mechanism is static RE only - the card's console
 * is not reachable, so we have never observed the drop. With the standby
 * thread suppressed there is nothing left to emit a frame except the real
 * encode path, which splits the two remaining stories cleanly:
 *   NO FRAME   -> the rejection is real; nothing ever reaches the encoder.
 *   real frame -> the standby thread was winning the race and masking it.
 * M131: DEFAULT CHANGED 0 -> 1. With it at 0 the card draws NOSG_LOGO_Y over a
 * perfectly good capture, which is what hid real video from this project for
 * its entire life (M129). Set it to 0 only to reproduce a pre-M129 result.

 * truncate a transfer, and it also explains M91 without needing win_bufs_first.
