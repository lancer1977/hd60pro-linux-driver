 * M71: SET_VIC byte6 = "fw", the card's ENCODER SELECTOR, not a pixel format.
 * video_capture_mgr compares it to 7 and 8 to launch ./tinyvenc7 / ./tinyvenc8

 * encoder in its own argv. We had been sending 2 or 3 here (a misread of the
 * field as "2=progressive, 3=interlaced"), which reached tinyvenc5 only by
 * fallthrough. 5 is the H.264 encoder this card uses. Exposed as a parameter
 * so the alternative can be bisected on hardware without a rebuild.
 *
 * M82 supersedes the value, not the meaning. The Windows driver's own
 * [CH00] log prints byte6 as "fw" and byte7 as "vi", and across all four
 * live traces it sends fw = 6 for 1080p30 / 1080p29.97 and fw = 7 for
 * 1080p60. It never sends 5. Since vcm derives the capture cfg's "output
 * format" from this byte (2/YUY2 when fw == 6, else 1/YV12) and spawns
 * ./tinyvenc7 when it is 7, 5 and 6 differ in the pixel format the capture
 * stage is told to produce - and 5 is a value the retail driver has never
 * exercised.
 *
 * M88 (hardware): and yet **only fw = 5 works on this card.** Bisected against
 * the splash oracle with everything else held at its M82 value - the Windows
 * ordering, the new color_info/fast_kill/nosg/aic_int_mode, INTx - flipping
 * this one byte is the whole difference:
 *
 *     fw = 5  -> tinyvenc5, cfg output format 1/YV12  -> splash renders
 *     fw = 6  -> tinyvenc5, cfg output format 2/YUY2  -> nothing written
 *     fw = 7  -> tinyvenc7, cfg output format 1/YV12  -> nothing written
 *
 * 5 and 6 differ ONLY in the cfg's output format, so YUY2 by itself stops the
 * capture loop before it writes anything; 7 fails separately, through a
 * different encoder binary. Windows sends 6 or 7 and captures, so something
 * about the card's state differs from ours and this byte is where it surfaces
 * - but a value that demonstrably kills the capture loop is not one to ship
 * for the sake of parity. 0 selects the Windows rule (6 at <=30 fps, 7 above)
 * for anyone re-testing that contradiction.
 *
 * M159/M161 OVERTURN the "fw = 7 -> nothing written" line above. That verdict
 * came from the pre-M129 regime - splash oracle, post_mask=0x1f truncating the
 * DMA, fake_frame_off unset - which M129 says invalidates every negative of
 * that era, and this was one. Re-measured with the M129 recipe, fw=7 is the
 * ONLY value that streams: 1621 completion interrupts in 57 s, fifo_drops=0,
 * the frame-token register cycling 0->1->2->3 1558 times. fw=5 raises
 * frame_events=0 - always has - and delivers one frame per encoder process
 * because tinyvenc5's build never writes its mma_already_start latch (M158).
 *
 * The default stays 5 only because fw=7 currently transfers 16 bytes per frame
 * instead of 3110400 (M161, card-side, unresolved). When that is fixed, 7 is

 * previous tinyvenc5 before it spawns the next one (vcm 0x9554):
 *
 *   fk == 1  ->  "SIG   KILL"  kill(pid, 9)      - no cleanup at all
 *   fk != 1  ->  "SIG    INT"  kill(pid, 2), then poll kill(pid,0) every
 *                10 ms up to 200 times (2 s) for a clean exit, and only
 *                then fall back to killall -9
 *
 * tinyvenc5 handles SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGSEGV with sig_kill() (0x187ec), which
 * runs EncodingGroup::~EncodingGroup() and exit(0) - so the SIGINT path also
 * gets the atexit chain, i.e. SSM_Recycle -> shm_unlink and
 * MemBroker_FreeMemory. Under SIGKILL none of that runs, which is the best
 * candidate for the 8-18 spawn wedge (RE_FINDINGS M157).
 *
 * Neutral on capture: verified on hardware, full 3110400-byte frame, NOT
 * SPLASH, CHROMA OK. Costs at most the card's own teardown wait, which hides
 * inside our existing SET_VIC settle.

/*
 * M136/M138: SET_VIC byte 34 - NOT the frame-completion interrupt enable.
 *
 * Found in ep.ko, not guessed. pciep_isr's cmd-41 arm (0x171c) ends with:
 *
 *   1744: ldrb r1, [r4, #0x22]     @ SET_VIC payload byte 34
 *   1748: adds r3, r1, #0
 *   174c: movne r3, #1
 *   1754: strb r3, [r5, #0x630]    @ state[0x630] = (byte34 != 0)
 *
 * and state[0x630] IS read by store_channel_done() - the sysfs attribute the
 * CARD's userspace writes when a channel finishes a frame:
 *
 *   e88: ldrb r3, [r1, #0x630]
 *   e8c: cmp  r3, #0
 *   e94: beq  0xefc                @ int_mode == 0: the OTHER branch
 *
 * M138 CORRECTION - this byte is NOT the EVENT gate. Both branches of that
 * test raise the EVENT the same way, and both are gated on the same thing: the
 * one-shot completion credit at ep.ko's .data[0].
 *
 *   e98: ldr r0, [credit] ; beq 0xed8   @ int_mode != 0 branch: no credit ->
 *   f08: ldr r8, [credit] ; beq 0xf34   @ int_mode == 0 branch:  accumulate
 *   f54: ldr r0, [credit] ; beq 0xfb4   @ ditto, aic_int_mode != 1
 *
 * The only difference between the branches is the shift used for the AUDIO
 * channel bit (r0+15 vs r4+16). For video the code is identical. So byte 34
 * cannot change frame reporting, which is exactly what M137 measured.
 *
 * The credit itself is fine: it starts at 1, every raised event consumes it,
 * and card IRQ 42 (pciep_isr_clrint) restores it - reached from the host by
 * BAR0[0x00] = MZ0380_MB_INT_ACK (0x400, bit 10; 0x800/bit 11 is IRQ 43, the
 * command dispatcher). M133's 1224 completed commands prove that path re-arms
 * it 1000+ times per run. See mz0380_credit_rearm().
 *
 * Kept as a knob only because it is free and the AIC twin (SET_AIC byte 17 ->

 * M130: MST3367 BANK0 0x92 - the CSC control byte.

 *
 *   0x92        0x40                 <- this byte: control

 *                                     rewritten straight afterwards)
 *
 * Why it matters (M129/M130): the captured frame's luma is perfect and its
 * chroma is 96% ANTI-correlated with luma - the signature of a matrix
 * subtracting luma from channels that are already luma-free. HDMI YCbCr 4:4:4
 * puts Cb on the blue channel, Y on green and Cr on red, so feeding it to an
 * RGB->YCbCr matrix gives Cb_out = -0.291*Y + ..., exactly what we measure.
 * Inverting that model on the captured frame turns the picture from
 * magenta/green mush into a coherent image, which confirms the mechanism.
 *
 * hdcapm writes this table unconditionally. Its MST3367_HdmiGetPacketColor()
 * reads the input colour space from BANK2 0x48 bits 6:5 and caches it in
 * regb2r48_cached - and then never uses it to pick a matrix. That is fine on
 * hdcapm's board, whose EDID makes sources send RGB. We push no EDID at all
 * (M127) and this source picked YUV444, which our own link log reports on
 * every run: "48=d2 ... input colorspace YUV444".
 *
 * With YCbCr in and YCbCr 4:2:2 out over BT1120, no conversion is wanted. If
 * 0x40 is the CSC enable, 0 should bypass it and the chroma should come out
 * right. That is one spawn and it is the cheapest thing that could work; the
 * fixed-point format of the coefficients has NOT been cracked, so do not try
 * to hand-write a matrix yet.
