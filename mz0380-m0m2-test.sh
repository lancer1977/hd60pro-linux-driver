# Staged bring-up test for the RE-corrected BAR0 mailbox + firmware model.
#
#   Stage M0 (read-only, safe): load probe-safe, dump the BAR0 mailbox and
#   extended BAR5 snapshot so we can see whether the low BAR0 mailbox region
#   responds pre-boot (i.e. is NOT stuck at 0xffffffff). This validates the
#   RE finding that the mailbox lives in BAR0 before committing to an upload.
#
#   Stage M2 is GONE. It attempted a firmware upload, and this driver has no
#   upload path: the card boots its own flash image. Do not re-add it.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./mz0380-m0m2-test.sh m0     # read-only observability
#   sudo ./mz0380-m0m2-test.sh m4     # bus master + MSI handshake
#
