# M55: real HDMI capture. The normal path requires a coherent receiver lock
# and uses BT1120 -> SSM -> H.264. NOSG=1 remains available only as an
# explicit card-side fake-frame/DMA diagnostic.
#
# M54 found one: a digital microscope drives the wire and the MST3367
# reached lock (detect 0x55=0xa3 LOCKED, htot=0x898=2200 = the horizontal
# total of 1080p). The DSLR still stays dark, which is the EDID blocker and
# is not what this script tests.
#
# Lock can be intermittent while the source settles, so timings are queried
# throughout the source power-cycle window. Unmatched/torn counters are never
# coerced to a guessed video mode.
#
# Decision table:
#   - "MST3367 signal:" followed by valid H.264 NAL units with NOSG=0 -> real
#     capture works end-to-end.
#   - query-dv-timings keeps returning ENOLCK -> the source dropped lock;
#     power-cycle it, or raise signal_poll_ms.
#   - timings fine but 0 bytes captured -> the encoder armed but no frame
#     completed: compare with the nosg path (m50), which does deliver, and
#     look for 'stream start' + enc_stat lines in dmesg.
#   - frames arrive but decode to garbage -> the per-mode receiver config
#     (M10 step 2, still unrecovered) is wrong for this source's mode.

# The previous run answered the open question: the watch reported 55=03
# no-lock, unchanged, for the whole 60s window - so the card was not dropping
# frames, the source was simply silent. HPD is raised once during bring-up and
# then never moves, so a source that has already given up has no reason to
# retry. M48/M49 proved this source reacts to a hotplug EDGE, so pulse HPD
# repeatedly across the capture window and watch between the pulses.
#
# The writes are serialised on purpose: /proc/mz0380-hdmi runs "watch" inline,
# so a concurrent hpd write would just block behind it. Alternating in one
# background shell gives edges at roughly t+7s, t+21s and t+35s.
# M74: WATCH=0 runs the capture with NO concurrent receiver I2C at all.
# The watch samples the MST3367 every 250ms and, until M74, re-armed

# acquisition registers on a receiver that was mid-capture. Writes are now
