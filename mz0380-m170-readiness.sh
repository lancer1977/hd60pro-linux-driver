# M170: is this a V4L2 device other people's software can use?
#
# Every capture in this project's history was driven by a script in this tree
# that already knew the answer - the geometry, the format, the frame count. That
# is why M168 found a node advertising the wrong fourcc and refusing to
# enumerate its own frame sizes: nothing had ever asked it anything.
#
# This runs the two tests that ask.
#
#   1. v4l2-compliance, the standard conformance suite. The non-streaming pass
#      exercises the whole ioctl surface and costs ZERO encoder spawns.
#   2. Repeat capture. The card is a single-shot grabber, so the product is a
#      still grabber, and the first thing anyone will do is take a SECOND still.
#      Nothing has ever verified that STREAMOFF/STREAMON yields another good
#      frame - M39 says a fresh spawn delivers one, but no run has taken three
#      in a row and compared them. Costs one spawn per still.
#
# Spawn cost: STILLS (default 3). The card wedges somewhere in the 8-18 range
# per power cycle, so check the budget first:  ./mz0380-spawns.sh
