# M52: can a wedged card be recovered WITHOUT a mains-off cold boot?
#
# The wedge (hit after ~8-18 encoder spawns): the card's mailbox stops ACKing
# everything - CMD_INIT times out (-110) and the driver reports "the mailbox is
# deaf". rmmod/insmod does not help. M157 named the likely cause (SIGKILLed
# encoders never run their cleanup) but that is a way to stop reaching the
# wedge, not a way out of one. This script walks the escalating PCI-level
# resets the kernel offers for the device and tests the mailbox after each:
#
#   1. pm  reset  - D3hot -> D0 power-state bounce
#   2. bus reset  - secondary-bus (hot) reset on the upstream bridge;
#                   if the slot's PERST# is routed into the SoC's reset
#                   tree this reboots the card's ARM Linux
#   3. remove + rescan - full re-enumeration on top of a bus reset
#
# Verdict per stage comes from reloading the module and looking for the
# mailbox answering (CMD_INIT ok / fw READY / "already runs firmware").
#
# Decision table:
#   - "RECOVERED after <stage>"  -> cold boot NOT needed; use this stage
#     as the standard recovery (and consider automating it in the driver).
#   - all three fail             -> the SoC really does keep running through
#     PCIe resets; mains-off cold boot is the only recovery.
#
# Only meaningful ON A WEDGED CARD. Run the 2 s check first (M149) - if
# CMD_INIT answers, there is nothing here to recover.
