# M45: watch the receiver's detect block LIVE while the source reacts.
#
# The key observation this is built around: running the bring-up visibly stops
# the connected camera's live preview. That is what a camera does when it
# detects an HDMI sink and switches its output to HDMI - so the source IS
# responding to our HPD, and the sink side is not as dead as "no lock"
# suggested. This correlates what the camera does with what the chip sees.
#
# Also settled by M44: MST3367 BANK3 is NOT writable (0/7 pattern bytes held),
# so it is not the EDID store - that lead is closed.
#
# WHAT TO DO WHILE IT RUNS (it watches for 40 s):
#   1. leave it alone for ~10 s (baseline),
#   2. UNPLUG the HDMI cable from the card,
#   3. PLUG it back in,
#   4. if the camera has an "HDMI output" / "record" mode toggle, cycle it.
#
# HOW TO READ THE "detect" LINES:
#   55=xx changes when you unplug/replug
#       -> the low bits of 0x55 track cable/5V presence: the receiver really
#          is wired to the connector and sees the source. Then "no-lock" with
#          idle counters means the source is attached but NOT transmitting
#          TMDS -> it is refusing because it cannot read a valid EDID, and
#          the EDID store is the thing still to find.
#   hper/vper/htot counters become non-zero (idle is vper=1fff, htot=0000)
#       -> the receiver IS seeing a TMDS clock: the source transmits, and the
#          fault is the receiver's per-mode configuration (M10 step 2 values,
#          which we never recovered) rather than the EDID.
#   LOCKED appears
#       -> re-run mz0380-m42-real-signal-test.sh immediately.
#   nothing changes at all, even on unplug
#       -> 0x55's low bits are static and the receiver is not wired to this
#          connector's hotplug/5V; suspect the input select (op41 input code)
#          or that the card routes a different physical input.
