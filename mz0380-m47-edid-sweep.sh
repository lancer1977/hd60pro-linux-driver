# M47: find the opcode that actually gets an EDID into the card.
#
# State of play:
#   - The receiver is alive and configured (register read-back proves it), the
#     input is now selected before bring-up, HPD is asserted - and the source
#     still never transmits.
#   - The EDID is the one link we have NEVER verified. op 0x1f returned
#     success but stored nothing; op 0x20 returned -110, our own timeout,
#     while the very next command worked fine - i.e. the card posts no
#     completion for it, exactly like START_STREAMING (op 6, M22).
#   - We cannot verify by read-back: nothing answers at the DDC address on
#     this bus. THE SOURCE IS THE ORACLE - a camera switches to HDMI output
#     mode only once it can read a valid EDID.
#
# So sweep the plausible opcodes fire-and-forget and WATCH THE CAMERA.
#
# WHAT TO DO: keep the camera powered, HDMI cable in, its screen visible.
# For each variant the script pushes the EDID and re-pulses HPD, then waits.
# WATCH THE CAMERA'S SCREEN each time.
#
# THE ANSWER:
#   camera flips to HDMI-output mode on variant X  -> X is the working EDID
#       opcode. Tell me which one; it becomes the default and the receiver
#       should then lock (the script prints the detect row after each push).
#   camera never reacts, detect stays 55=03 hper=0000 vper=1fff
#       -> no host opcode in fw 1.11 can store an EDID. Remaining options:
#          (a) capture a live Windows I2C trace of UpdateEDID (also yields the
#              per-mode config values from M10 step 2 that we still lack),
#          (b) check whether the card's own userspace (yuan_ioctrl) serves the
#              EDID from flash and simply needs a different trigger.
