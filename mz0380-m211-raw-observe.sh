# M211: do the op02/op08 raw banks fill while the ENCODED path is running?
#
# M209 started the raw ring alone and the producer never ran.  M210 added the
# entire Windows encoder tail and it still never ran: SET_VIC, both
# SET_ENC_PARAMS, SET_PREVIEW_PARAMS, and events=0 with all eight slots
# poison-intact.  The one structural difference left is the op 0x04 encoded
# window, which those runs never registered - so the working assumption flips:
# tinyvenc validates its whole output set before starting anything.
#
# This run therefore does what Windows does - registers op02, op08 AND op04 -
# and rides the known-good h264_probe path that already delivers 60 fps.  It is
# passive with respect to that path: V4L2 still negotiates H.264, completion
# routing and delivery are untouched, and the raw banks are only poisoned,
# registered, and read back at stop.
#
# It also samples the first sixteen bytes of each op02 slot on every encoded
# completion (M212) and logs them when they change.  Point the camera at
# something that visibly changes - wave a hand, cover the lens, swing it from a
# lamp to a dark corner - and those samples answer M128a's open question:
# sixteen bytes that track the scene are source pixels, which makes this a DMA
# that dies after one burst rather than a capture that never happens.
#
# Scoring is the poison: if any op02/op08 slot reports a non-zero extent after a
# live encoded capture, the raw surface exists and is a by-product of the
# encoded pipeline.  If all eight are pristine, the ring is not the Linux raw
# source and the search goes back to the Windows binary.
