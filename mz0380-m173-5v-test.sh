# M173: do R55 bits 0-1 track the HDMI cable?
#
# M45 asked this and never answered it. mz0380-mst3367.c has carried the guess
# ever since - "we consistently read 0x03 - bits the driver does not use, most
# plausibly 5V/clock presence" - and M45's own note said "the natural reading is
# 5V/cable presence and/or clock detect".
#
# It matters because V4L2_CID_DV_RX_POWER_PRESENT is the last thing between this
# driver and a clean v4l2-compliance warning column, and that control is the
# standard way an application tells "nothing plugged in" from "plugged in but
# not transmitting". Backing it with a hypothesis would export a guess to every
# client that reads it, in the one place a client is entitled to trust.
#
# Two single reads are not enough: they are indistinguishable unless you already
# know which one had the cable in, and that is precisely the ambiguity that
# makes a wrong conclusion easy. So this watches continuously and prints every
# CHANGE, and you do the unplugging while it runs.
#
# Costs ZERO encoder spawns and needs NO root - /proc/mz0380-hdmi is
# world-readable and reading it does a live receiver read. The module must
# already be loaded.
