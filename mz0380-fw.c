/*
 *  Driver for MZ0380 based capture cards.
 *
 *  Card bring-up handshake. NO FIRMWARE IS EVER UPLOADED.
 *
 *  The Elgato HD60 Pro is a "smart" capture card: its YUAN MZ0380 PCIe
 *  endpoint boots its own embedded Linux from ONBOARD FLASH, on an ARMv5
 *  SoC, without any help from the host. That image carries the ARM binaries
 *  (tinyvenc, video_capture_mgr) plus the on-card kernel module ep.ko which
 *  serves the PCIe mailbox.
 *
 *  This driver deliberately does NOT push an image to the card. It is a
 *  standing project constraint, and it is also what the retail Windows
 *  driver does in practice - its DriverEntry logs
 *      TOTAL DOWNLOAD TIMES = 00000000 (6 BYTES) (SUCCESS) (1.11)
 *      BOARD VERSION: 1.11 / 1.11
 *  i.e. only the 6-byte version file is read, the versions match, and no
 *  image moves. The MZ0380.HD.HEX that used to ship with this tree was
 *  byte-identical to Elgato's shipping image (sha256 be0d5e19...), so there
 *  was never anything to gain by sending it - only ~21 s per insmod and a way
 *  to brick the card.
 *
 *  What this file does now:
 *    - read the expected version from the MZ0380.FW.TXT sidecar (there is
 *      no version-query opcode; this is where Windows gets it too),
 *    - handshake with the firmware already running on the card
 *      (mz0380_card_init: CMD_INIT + GET_BOARD_VERSION),
 *    - report any mismatch loudly and carry on with what is running.
 *
 *  Nothing here uploads, and no part of the upload protocol survives anywhere
 *  in the tree - not the opcodes, not the BAR0 aperture define, not the module
 *  parameter, not the .HEX blob names. Do not re-add any of it.
