# M54: is the card sending the trigger, and does THIS source answer it?
#
# The trigger a source waits for is two things: HPD asserted on the
# connector, then a readable EDID over DDC. HPD is ours to drive (GPIO pin1
# + receiver BANK0 0xb7); the EDID is the unsolved blocker. This script
# separates "we are not triggering" from "we trigger and the source refuses
# for lack of EDID", and then watches whether the source transmits anyway.
#
# Why a different source matters: many devices transmit with no readable
# EDID at all, and those would light up the whole capture path today.
#   GOOD candidates: Raspberry Pi with hdmi_force_hotplug=1 (+ hdmi_group/
#     hdmi_mode set) - it drives HDMI without reading an EDID; cheap media
#     players / set-top boxes / DVD players; some action cams.
#   BAD candidates: PCs and laptops (they refuse without EDID, same as the
#     DSLR), and anything that insists on HDCP.
#
# Decision table:
#   1. "MST3367 receiver brought up" and NOT "still silent" -> receiver is
#      alive; the GPIO-direction damage from the M51 probe is repaired.
#   2. "HPD asserted -> pin1 reads 1" -> the card IS driving the trigger.
#      A "PIN DID NOT FOLLOW" line means it is not, and nothing downstream
#      matters until that is fixed.
#   3. In the watch output: any change in the detect block after the source
#      is plugged/powered = the source started transmitting -> real capture
#      is now testable (stream_nosg=0). A frozen block = the source is
#      staying dark, i.e. it wants the EDID.
#
# Usage: run it, and when it says so, power-cycle / re-plug the source.
