# M77: prove the LOAD_FILES (op 0x6e) transport before anything touches the
# card's boot image.
#
# video_capture_mgr's op-0x6e handler is an arbitrary-offset 16-byte read of
# /mnt/flash/PIC_ENC, and it echoes the serviced command back to the host, so
# the bytes come home in PARAM1..PARAM4. /proc/mz0380-cardlog pages the file
# out through it (RE_FINDINGS.md M76).
#
# This run costs ZERO encoder spawns - no STREAMON, no SET_VIC - so it does not
# touch the ~8-18 spawn wedge budget, and it writes nothing to the card.
#
# Decision:
#   - plausible file bytes (or a clean all-zero/short read) -> transport works,
#     and redirecting the card's stdout into that file gives us its console.
#   - every chunk "<read failed>" -> op 0x6e does not answer for us and the
#     console-over-PCIe plan is dead; fall back to the board's UART.
